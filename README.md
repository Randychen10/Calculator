This project is a console-based calculator application in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations, with functionality for handling complex expressions. Key features include:

Basic Operations: The calculator supports essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Each operation is evaluated based on operator precedence, ensuring correct results for complex expressions.

Parenthesis Handling: The calculator processes expressions with parentheses, allowing users to control the order of operations explicitly. Nested and multiple parentheses are supported, enabling complex calculations.

Expression Parsing: Using a custom parser, the calculator reads and interprets expressions input by the user. It breaks down expressions, manages operands and operators, and evaluates them based on their precedence.

Error Detection: The program detects and handles common errors, such as division by zero, mismatched parentheses, and invalid characters, ensuring robust and accurate computation.

Interactive Console Interface: Users can input expressions directly into the console, and the calculator provides immediate feedback with the result. This setup allows users to perform multiple calculations in a single session.

Efficient Evaluation: The project uses a stack-based approach for managing operands and operators, which optimizes the evaluation of expressions by minimizing redundant calculations.

This calculator demonstrates core programming concepts like data structures, operator precedence, and error handling, making it an excellent project for practicing Java fundamentals and expression evaluation techniques.
